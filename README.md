# Vampiric Bloodlines
### This is an addon for Vampirism that adds a Bloodline mechanic for Vampires, changing the way you play. 

# Vampire Bloodlines
Bloodlines significantly change the way you play as a Vampire. While each new bloodline rank may come with some penalties, it will also allow you to unlock powerful new skills. Most skills, including penalties, will become more potent with higher bloodline ranks.
Each bloodline comes with 4 Bloodline Ranks, enhancing their innate abilities and gaining the ability to unlock new parts of their Skill Tree.
