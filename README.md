# Bloodlines
### This is an addon for Vampirism that adds a Bloodline mechanic for vampires and hunters, changing the way you play. 


# Bloodline Mechanics

Bloodlines significantly change the way you play within each faction. While each new bloodline rank may come with some penalties, it will also allow you to unlock powerful new skills. Most skills, including penalties, will become more potent with higher bloodline ranks.
Each bloodline comes with 4 Bloodline Ranks, enhancing their innate abilities and gaining the ability to unlock new parts of their Skill Tree.


### Joining a Bloodline

To join a Bloodline, a player needs to complete a task unique to that Bloodline.
Alternatively, some modpacks may require the use of a Bloodline Fang. These can no longer be crafted, but are available for creative use / modpack use. 

### Leaving a Bloodline

In order to leave a Bloodline, a player can use the Purity Injection. This can be crafted with an empty syringe, milk bucket and golden apple.

### Levelling & Skill Tree

Bloodlines have a Skill Tree and a Rank. You can increase your Bloodline Rank by doing quests at a faction representative. This will enhance the innate aspects of the Bloodline, as well as furthering the Skill Tree.

The Bloodline Skill Tree can be accessed from Vampirism's Skill Tree Menu. Each Bloodline Skill Tree follows a general path with skills branching out from the "Bloodline Rank Skills". These are special skills that cannot be unlocked. Instead,
they are automatically given when you level up your Bloodline Rank.

Additionally, skills from the Bloodline Tree require their own bloodline perk points instead of regular skill points. These are gained by doing quests from the faction representative, like the levelling quests.

# Hunter Bloodlines

## Gravebound Bloodline

Gravebounds are a unique and rare form of Vampire Hunter. They have embraced undeath to defeat their enemies, their hunger bar is replaced with a soul meter, which can only be replenished by devouring the souls of their enemies.
While they do not need to eat, they have significantly reduced natural healing, reduced XP gain and worse trade prices. They make up for this with near immortality and a set of powerful abilities.

Gravebounds also require a Phylactery. If this is destroyed, their max souls will be significantly reduced. The Phylactery can also store souls using a Soul Binder, which can also be used to bind to a new Phylactery. The total amount of souls that can be stored is based on the amount of creatures devoured.


- Mist Form - Automatically unlocked with Rank 3, instead of dying a Gravebound will go into Mist Form automatically, if they have enough souls. They can then choose to resurrect themselves.


- Ghost Walk - Consumes a significant amount of souls, but allows them to walk through most objects


- Phylactery Teleportation - In exchange for some souls, teleports them to their Phylactery.


- Possession - Allows them to take control of certain mobs, particularly undead mobs, but also villagers, silverfish and creepers. They can attack and interact using that mob.


- Soul Infusion - Consumes some souls to quickly regenerate health.

### Joining

To become Gravebound, you must create both a Rending Elixir and Heinous Elixir, and create your own Phylactery.
Place down the Phylactery, then drink both the Heinous Elixir and the Rending Elixir. 
If you die from this, you are resurrected at the Phylactery as a Gravebound
